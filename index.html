    				<p>Emma Woods is a NYC-based musical theatre actress. She began performing as soon as she could talk and sing, and took piano lessons from a young age until she decided she'd like to focus on her vocal training instead. After moving from a small town in Minnesota to Calgary, Alberta, she took two years of vocal lessons from esteemed vocal coach Brian Farrell (Calgary, AB). She attended North Dakota State University and earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Musical Theater.  </p>

    				<p>Although she started college as a History major, she was eventually recruited into the BFA Theatre program. Throughout her time in Fargo, ND, she appeared as Joanna in <i>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street</i>, Maureen in <i>RENT</i>, Rachel Jackson in <i>Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson</i>, Elizabeth (Wife) in <i>The Christians</i>, and Ivy in <i>bare: a pop opera</i>, which she performed at the 2014 Edinburgh Fringe Festival and received several 5-star reviews.</p>

    				<p>After graduation, Emma accepted a summer position at Florida Repertory Theatre in Fort Myers, Florida, which eventually turned into a full-time internship at the Rep. She spent a year and a half working in Florida and building skills offstage.  </p>

    				<p>Emma moved to New York City in 2018 with her then-fiance to begin her professional acting career. They married on September 1st, 2019 in Minnesota and currently live in Brooklyn with their cats Joe Mauer and Arya Stark. Emma loves playing videogames, reading, playing with her cats, video chatting with friends and family, running, cooking, watching <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, and updating her pinterest board with her dream apartment. She and her husband love to travel and hope to be able to do so as soon as the pandemic is over!  </p>
